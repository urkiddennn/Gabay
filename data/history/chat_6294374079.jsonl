Example: \u201cGood day, Ma\u2019am/Sir. I am a student \u2026\u201d | Makes the text flow naturally and avoids visual clutter. |\n| **Date Format** | \u201cMarch,12/2022\u201d | Use a standard format such as \u201c12\u202fMarch\u202f2022\u201d or \u201c03/12/2022\u201d. | Reduces ambiguity and follows business\u2011letter conventions. |\n| **Salutation & Closing** | \u201cMa\u2019am/sir.\u201d and \u201cSincerely;\u201d | Use a consistent salutation (e.g., \u201cDear Sir/Madam,\u201d) and a proper closing (\u201cSincerely,\u201d). | Aligns with formal business\u2011letter etiquette. |\n| **Signature Block** | Mixed name order and missing titles (e.g., \u201cBANGUIZ,RICHARD T.\u201d, \u201cBANGUIZ,LILET T.\u201d) | Separate the requester\u2019s signature from the approver\u2019s, include full names, titles, and contact info. Example: <br>```\\nRichard T. Banguiz\\nStudent, 1CSC/CITE Dept.\\nNorth Eastern Mindanao State University\\n``` | Clarifies who is sending the request and who approves it. |\n| **Formatting & Alignment** | Random line breaks, inconsistent indentation, \u201c---\u201d separators, and mis\u2011aligned tables. | Use a clean, left\u2011aligned layout; keep tables with proper borders; avoid unnecessary horizontal lines. | Improves visual appeal and makes the document easier to scan. |\n| **Clarity of Instructions** | \u201cMake a written communication for the conduct of an interview.\u201d followed by a draft that still contains errors. | Provide a step\u2011by\u2011step template (subject line, greeting, purpose, request, gratitude, signature). | Helps the writer produce a polished request on the first try. |\n| **Completeness** | Section 4 (\u201cPostCopy and Paste here any mode of verification \u2026\u201d) is empty. | Add the actual verification material (e.g., a link to a video, a screenshot, or a note that it will be attached). | Demonstrates that the interview was conducted and provides evidence. |\n| **Consistency of Names** | The document alternates between \u201cBANGUIZ, LILET\u201d and \u201cBANGUIZ, RICHARD T.\u201d without indicating roles. | Clearly label each person\u2019s role (e.g., \u201cRequester: Richard T. Banguiz\u201d, \u201cApprover: Lilet Banguiz\u201d). | Prevents confusion about who is responsible for each part. |\n| **Use of Bullets/Numbering** | Long paragraphs without breaks. | Break the request into bullet points or numbered steps (e.g., 1. Introduction, 2. Purpose, 3. Request, 4. Closing). | Enhances readability and ensures no information is omitted. |\n| **Reference to Attachments** | No mention of any attached interview guide or consent form. | Add a line such as \u201cPlease find attached the interview questionnaire and consent form.\u201d | Shows preparedness and professionalism. |\n| **Overall Tone** | Slightly informal (\u201cGood day, Ma\u2019am/sir\u201d) and occasional first\u2011person \u201cI\u201d. | Keep a formal tone throughout, using \u201cWe\u201d if representing a student group, or \u201cI\u201d consistently with a polite opening. | Aligns with the formal nature of business correspondence. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick Revised Sample (for illustration)\n\n```\n12 March 2022\n\nRichard T.
